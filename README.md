# Java7MatrixModule
## Colin Benist
This is a Work in Progress Matrix module for Java 7. I recently finished  a Linear Algebra course that worked a lot with matrices. These are some things that i found would have been useful to have.

###The methods that are currently Available:
  * Matrix Addition
  * Matrix Multiplication
  * Matrix Scaling
  * Matrix Reduce to Echelon Form
  * Matrix Reduce to Reduced Echelon Form
  * Matrix Augmentation 

###Methods I plan on implementing in the future:
  * Inverting matrix
  * Transposing matrix
  * Suggestions?
