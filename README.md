# Java7MatrixModule
## Colin Benist
This is a Matrix module for Java 7. I recently finished  a Linear Algebra course that worked a lot with matrices. These are some things that I found would have been useful to have. My Software Development 2 Course: ggc-itec.github.io


###The methods that are currently Available:
  * Matrix Addition
  * Matrix Multiplication
  * Matrix Scaling
  * Matrix Reduce to Echelon Form
  * Matrix Reduce to Reduced Echelon Form
  * Matrix Augmentation 
  * Inverting Matrices
  * Transposing Matrices
  * Finding the Determinant of Matrices

###Methods I plan on implementing in the future:
  * Suggestions?
